# Introduction
Sirius Proxima is a rust based program that I use for automating IOTs at my home and home-office. This is a work in progress. The source code [rust] for the ESP32 based satellite IOT module is available here: [Siris Alpha](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/sirius-alpha, "Siris Alpha")


### Setup

**Enable CARGO: support items generated by build scripts in Intellij**

- Ref: https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4734#issue-534383976
- Goto Help | Find Action | Experimental Features dialog > Enable > `org.rust.cargo.evaluate.build.scripts` and `org.rust.macros.procs`

**Increase code insight features**

- Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/a/23058324/1317099
- Goto Help menu, Edit Custom Properties > Add > `idea.max.intellisense.filesize=10000`

**Install TLS/HTTPS**
- Ref: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
- Ref: https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/security/rustls/

```shell
# macos
$ brew install mkcert
$ brew install nss 

# this will install a trusted developer's certificate for the local use
$ mkcert -install

# replace the `<xxx.xxx.x.xx>` with your ip addresses
$ mkcert -key-file /path/key.pem -cert-file /path/cert.pem 127.0.0.1 <xxx.xxx.x.xx> <xxx.xxx.x.xx>
```

### Run

- Note: Modify the `CHRONO_TZ_TIMEZONE_FILTER` env variable according to your TZ choice. This is done to treeshake the `chrono_tz` crate.

```shell
# to watch
$ cargo watch -x 'run --bin sirius-proxima'

# to run 
$ cargo run

# to build 
$ cargo build --release

```
